# Expedition

Expedition is a gem for interacting with cgminer and cgminer-compatible APIs.
The goal of this project is to offer Rubyists easier integration with the
[cgminer API](https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/blob/master/API-README) “the
Ruby way.”

**tl;dr** This gem lets you interact with cgminer’s API the way a Ruby hipster
would want to.
